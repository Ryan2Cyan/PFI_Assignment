Pyramid Scheme is a fun take on the classic arcade asteroid-destroyer games. 

In Pyramid Scheme the user takes control of a small, yellow, pyramid-like ship, using whatever </br>
weapons of mass destruction available, to prevent asteroids from entering Earth's atmosphere below.</br> 
The ship is equipped with rail guns, plasma cannons, and a huge laser, just as an extra precaution.</br>

This game works with controller and has built-in gyro control functionality.

Made in the Unity game engine. </br>
Submitted as an assignment project at Bournemouth University (2022).</br>
